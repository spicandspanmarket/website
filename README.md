# Spic-and-Span-Site

June 2016 - complete redesign of the Spic and Span website.

Began with wireframe sketches and a color mockup of the home page (desktop and mobile version are included).

The site itself is built using standard HTML/CSS, a custom style framework largely based on skeleton.css, and the JQuery library. It is hosted on MagicEdit, which - with some proprietary tags - allows access to a very lightweight CMS, giving the administrator(s) access to simple content such as text and images.

The site is designed to be lightweight, static, and responsive, with the ultimate goal being to give users just enough information to entice them to come in to the store. The true value of Spic and Span becomes apparent when the consumer is physically in the store, and therefore the website must be provocative and informative.

Site content includes basic information on the store and the various services, menus for the deli, catering, and seasonal offerings, contact information.
